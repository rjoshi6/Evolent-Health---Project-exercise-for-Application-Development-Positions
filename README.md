# Evolent-Health---Project-exercise-for-Application-Development-Positions
Designed and Implemented a production technologies for maintaining contact information

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to work on this Evolent project exercise.

The repo consists of this README.md and a folder which contains HTML, php, CSS, JavaScript files and a .sql file which contains the database which was used while developing this application. 
This application was developed on XAMPP, it was hosted on the Apache localhost server, database used was MySQL, front-end development was implemented in HTML5 , validations performed with AngularJS. The database and front-end were connected using server-side scripting with php. 

Installing the Application:
XAMPP needs to be installed to view this application.
Apache server and MySQL must be started before running via the control panel for XAMPP.
The folder named "angularSPAevolent" must be put into the "htdocs" folder inside "Apache" folder in the xampp directory which is created once XAMPP is installed.
The .sql file must be imported in phpmyadmin or http://localhost:(portNumber)/phpmyadmin
I haven't added the password to the database intentionally. 

Once the above instructions are performed, the project can be accessed at http://localhost:(portNumber)/angularSPAevolent/

Please have a look at it, In the meantime I am figuring out how to deploy the application on EC2.
